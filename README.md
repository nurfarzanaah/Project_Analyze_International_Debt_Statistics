# Project_Analyze_International_Debt_Statistics
The project is guided by Sayak Paul, Machine Learning Engineer at Carted to solve real-world problems using SQL. It focuses on data manipulation using SQL to answer questions like:
  1. What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
  2. Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
  3. What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

The report for the project is presented using Jupyter Notebook. You may go for the notebook titled "analyze_international_debt_statistics" in the above.
